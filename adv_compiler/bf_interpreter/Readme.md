## Brainfuck Interpreter in C

The Brainfuck interpreter is designed to execute Brainfuck programs, which is a minimalist esoteric programming language created by Urban MÃ¼ller.

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the Brainfuck interpreter, you will need:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or another compatible C compiler

### Compiling the Interpreter

To compile the Brainfuck interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code file `super_opt.c`.
3. Run the following command to compile the interpreter:

```bash
gcc -O3 super_opt.c -o super_opt
```

This command will create an executable named `super_opt` in the same directory.

### Running a Brainfuck Program

To run a Brainfuck program using the compiled interpreter, you can use the following command:

```bash
./super_opt < path/to/your/brainfuck_program.b
```

Replace path/to/your/brainfuck_program.b with the path to the Brainfuck file you want to execute.
